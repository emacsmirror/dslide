# The top heading is used to generate the Release notes for the Github releases
# page.  Include changes in this file to avoid having to compile it all at
# every release.

* v0.5.6
** Added
- Breadcrumbs can have a trailing separator appended with ~dslide-breadcrumb-separator-style~.  Default is =append=.  To return to old behavior, configure to ~separate~.
- News file (this file)
** Changed
- Manual Kaizen
** Fixed
- When a step callback fails, it will be removed from the deck's list of callbacks, preventing infinite loops.  This respects ~debug-on-error~.
