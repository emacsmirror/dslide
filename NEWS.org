* v0.6.0 Fighting Spam 💌 :latest:
** Added ➕
** Changed 🙅
- Image action is now a default action (although default actions are going away.)
- Image action defaults =:standalone-display= to =nil=.  If you want fullscreen display, you need to set the option in the property drawer, the way it has been.  This was to support turning the image action on by default.
- ⚠️ Propertize action now warns on unquoted lists.  Please use quoted lists.  In my opinion, all lists should be considered quoted in org, but this change is consistent with babel parameters being evaluated when unquoted.
- Yet more manual Kaizen.  Seriously, check it out by installing dslide.
** Fixed 💩
- The image action will no longer haphazardly try to display links that don't look like an image.  Remote images, if they were working on your Emacs, may be affected.  File an issue, explain your setup, and workaround by downloading.
* v0.5.6 Let There Be News 🗞️
- ⛔ The concept of default actions has been marked for deprecation.  This is preparation for instantiating actions on-demand rather than per slide.  The action system may undergo some overhaul internally.
  + Markup will be reduced, not changed
  + Affiliated keywords such as =#+attr_dslide_propertize:= will be used more
  + Configuration of actions on the slide property drawer will be made unnecessary and then removed except for slide actions, which have higher association with the slide heading than any elements in the section.
** Added
- Breadcrumbs can have a trailing separator appended with ~dslide-breadcrumb-separator-style~.  Default is =append=.  To return to old behavior, select =separate=.
- News file (this file)
** Changed
- Manual Kaizen (continuous improvement)
** Fixed
- When a step callback fails, it will be removed from the deck's list of callbacks, preventing infinite loops.  This respects ~debug-on-error~.
