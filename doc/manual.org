* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: What is Dslide?
:END:
Dslide is designed for conducting presentations in Emacs.  Abstractly, a presentation is a scripted sequence of content.  Org mode documents are the primary means of encoding these sequences for dslide.

What dslide primarily adds to Emacs and Org Mode:

- Simplified user interface suitable for a presentation remote controller
- Data model that adapts Emacs to this interface
- Method of attaching reusable, configurable programmed behavior to org mode content
- Extensible framework for creating custom programmed behavior
- Presenter tools such as viewing hidden content invisible to the audience
** Design Goals
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Things Hopefully Achieved
:END:
Granular configurability was the first goal.  Dslide's predecessor, ~org-tree-slide~, could only be configured at the level of the entire document, using customize variables.  Dslide aims to be configureable over each element of each heading.

Programmability quickly became primary motivation to develop dslide further.  Org babel blocks can be used as steps of a dslide presentation.  By scripting Emacs via Elisp within org babel blocks, because Emacs sits on top of all your other programming tools and sub-processes, so does dslide.  The action system is a framework for attaching reusable, configurable programmed behavior to multiple headings.

High productivity was another goal.  With a decent org configuration, use basic markup to obtain a decent presentation.  Org mode's properties and keywords are used to attach and configure reusable behavior to elements and headings.  Dslide respects export settings, allowing content to vary between presentation and export.  You can use the presentation org document itself the same way you use other org documents, to store, organize, and publish information.
** Strengths
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: When Dslide is Perfect
:END:
Dslide is particularly good for presentations that are for internal use or intended for closed audiences, where lavish graphics that would be directed at end consumers is unneeded and could even be seen as an inappropriate expense of time:

- Tech demos where you need programming tools
- Early stage startup pitches
- Conducting team meetings
* Status
- Still pre-1.0.  See the [[https://github.com/positron-solutions/dslide/issues/20][version 1.0 feature roadmap]].
- Expect markup to become easier as affiliated keywords are adopted. Will attempt to not break options that currently work. See release notes when updating.
- Accepting PR's and issue reports. Read the manual section on [[*Hacking][hacking]]
- Some behaviors may be advertised as working already when they are only 90% implemented. I have no idea what you want. File issues.
* Glossary
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Words We Invented
:END:
- =Deck=: an object that is used to relate the display and base buffer and is the root of all sequences.  It's another word for "presentation" or PT.
- =Slide=: an object that interprets an org heading to hydrate its actions
- =Action=: an object that responds to ~dslide-deck-forward~ and ~dslide-deck-backward~ calls and implements lifecycle methods to initialize and clean up state.
  #+cindex: slide action
  + =Slide Action=: an action subclass that handles initial display of the slide and creation of child slides from sub-headings.
  #+cindex: section action
  + =Section Actions=: actions that typically control the display and behavior of a heading's section, the region between the headline and child headings.
#+cindex: secondary action
- =Secondary Action=: 🚧 To do "something else" besides step forwards and backwards, ~dslide-deck-start~ can be temporarily overloaded, allowing presentation controllers with three buttons to control extra behavior.
- =Step=: a single call to ~dslide-deck-foward~ or ~dslide-deck-backward~, usually delegated down to ~dslide-forward~ and ~dslide-backward~ methods through the deck and slides down to actions.  Actions implement steps.
#+cindex: element configuration
- =Element Configuration=: Some actions can be configured per-element.  This is done with an affiliated keyword such as =#+attr_dslide_propertize:= or the parameters of a block.  The value is the configuration for how to work on that element.
#+cindex: step configuration
- =Step Configuration=: When the element configuration is used by a step.  The babel block parameters that configure how to use that block as a step are its step configuration.
#+cindex: contents
- =Contents=: A view of the folded top-level headings that is used for quickly navigating between headings during a presentation.
#+cindex: slide buffer
- =Slide Buffer=: the slides are shown in an indirect buffer that is cloned from your org document buffer.  The source is called the *base buffer*.  Check for the =deck: my-presentation.org= buffer name.
  + Indirect buffer and =slide-buffer= are used interchangeably
  + Base buffer or =base-buffer= is used pretty exclusively
- =Stateful Sequence=: ~dslide-stateful-sequence~ is an interface that other classes implement when they will receive delegated commands from the user.
** Org Mode Terms
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Ones You Might Not Know
:END:
Select org mode terms more frequently used by dslide.  Don't miss [[info:org#Org Syntax][Org Syntax (org)]].

- =Element=: org documents are parsed into elements and objects.  Headings, plain lists, and blocks are examples of elements.  See the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][org element api]] documentation.  Dslide makes heavy use of org's element parser to implement its features.
- =Keyword=: A single =#+keyword_style:= line used to specify some option
- =Affilated keyword=: A =#+attr_keyword_style:= line that directly precedes an element and is used to add metadata to arbitrary org elements.  It must begin with the =attr= prefix! ⚠️
- =Parameter=: Babel blocks have parameters.  Whenever an action works mainly on blocks, it can use parameters rather than affiliated keywords.
- =Property drawer=: Used especially to configure a heading's slide action or how an action affects a heading element (affiliated keywords cannot apply to headings).  Can be used to configure section actions.
- =Property=: Values in the property drawer.  Meta data attached to headings. See [[info:org#Property Syntax][Property Syntax (org)]]

Making an org document into a presentation.
** Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Overview
:END:
By default, you just get one slide per heading, a header, and some animation.  This is not very exciting.  You need to add actions to slides to consume their section content in a more engaging way.

There are two kinds of actions:
- =Slide actions=: mostly responsible for narrowing to a slide and then handling the child headings, either inline or as separate slides
- =Section actions=: work on the content in the heading's section.

To browse all actions, because they are all EIEIO classes, you can use ~eieio-browse~ and see the actions descend from ~dslide-action~.

#+begin_src
  +--dslide-stateful-sequence
       +--dslide-action
            +--dslide-action-propertize
            +--dslide-action-image
            +--dslide-action-babel
            +--dslide-action-item-reveal
            +--dslide-action-hide-markup

                 +--dslide-slide-action-child
                 +--dslide-slide-action-flat
#+end_src
** Adding Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Making Content Do Stuff
:END:
#+vindex: dslide-default-actions
By default, every slide has two actions, configurable in ~dslide-default-actions~:
- ~dslide-action-propertize~ for adding text properties to arbitrary elements
- ~dslide-action-hide-markup~ to hide keywords, todo states, and tags, allowing you to have these things in your source without them cluttering the presentation

Non-default actions must be added to a slide using the slide's property drawer.  Actions that work by recognizing org elements by type are perhaps a bit dangerous to leave on all the time.

- =DSLIDE_SLIDE_ACTION=: Usually narrows to the slide and creates children from child headings.  Lifecycle encloses the section actions.
- =DSLIDE_ACTIONS:= Most commonly used.  You can list multiple actions.  Each one will step through its forward and backward steps.

#+begin_export html
Regular Org Mode markup is used to add actions to headings.  See more examples in the [[./test]] directory.
#+end_export

#+begin_src org
  ,* Full Screen Images
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DSLIDE_ACTIONS: dslide-action-images
  :END:
  ,#+attr_html: :width 50%
  [[./images/emacsen4.jpeg]] [[./images/before-google3.jpeg]]
#+end_src
** Action Arguments
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Tweaking Behavior
:END:
Many actions understand arguments, allowing tuning of similar behaviors from the same class.

To view an action's arguments, call ~describe-symbol~ on it.  Any slot definition usually has the same =:initarg= and will be understood when added as a plist-style argument.

Configuring the slot is done by adding plist-style properties after the class name:

#+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DSLIDE_ACTIONS: dslide-action-item-reveal :inline t
  :END:
#+end_src

You can also use "property+" syntax to add to a property, and these accept plist arguments too:

#+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DSLIDE_ACTIONS: dslide-action-babel
  :DSLIDE_ACTIONS+: dslide-action-images :full-frame t
  :END:
#+end_src

🚧 The current plist read implementation splits the string rather than using ~read-string~ and is therefore not smart enough to parse lists as arguments.  However ~dslide-action-propertize~ demonstrates doing this correctly and shows that it will be possible if needed.
** Annotating Elements
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Telling Actions What and Where
:END:
Some actions, such as ~dslide-action-propertize~, can't decide which elements to operate on or what to do with those elements.  You can add some meta data to an element using an *affiliated keyword*.

⚠️ If you are extending an action and want to create your own affiliated keyword, they  must start with =attr= or else the org element parser will not consider them affiliated and that property will not be set on the element!

#+begin_src org
  ,* Fancy Text
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DSLIDE_ACTIONS: dslide-action-propertize
  :END:
  Add text properties to an element using the =attr_dslide_propertize= affiliated keyword.  No quoting is required.  Lists will be interpreted as such.

  ,#+attr_dslide_propertize: face (:background "#ddddff" :foreground "#000000" :weight bold :height 2.0)
  This is some fancy text
#+end_src
** Babel Scripting
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Fully Programmable Steps
:END:
#+findex: dslide-action-babel
#+cindex: scripting babel steps
You can write custom scripts into your presentation as Org Babel blocks.  These can be executed with the ~dslide-action-babel~ action.

In the future the babel action may become a default, using the =#+attr_dslide_babel= affiliated keyword or =:noeval= to decide a block should not be executed.  As of this version of dslide, either add ~dslide-action-babel~ to your ~dslide-default-actions~ or add it to the actions list via the property drawer.

#+begin_src org
  ,* My Heading With Babel Blocks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DSLIDE_ACTIONS: dslide-action-babel
  :END:
  ,#+begin_src elisp
    (message "Good job!")
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

By default blocks only execute going forward, one block per step.  You need to label your blocks with [[*Life Cycles][lifecycle]] methods if you want to perform setup (forward and backward) and teardown.  See the ~dslide-action-babel~ class and examples in [[file:./test/demo.org][./test/demo.org]].

The =#+attr_dslide:= affiliated keyword is used to configure which methods will run the block.  Block labels that are understood:

- =begin= and =end= are run when the slide is instantiated, going forward and backward respectively.  You can have several blocks with these methods, and they will be run from *top-to-bottom* always, making it easier to re-use code usually.

- =final= is called to clean up when no progress can be made or if the presentation is stopped.

- =forward= and =backward= are self-explanatory.  Position your =backward= blocks *above* any block that they undo

- =both= runs either direction.  It will not repeat in place when reversing.  Use separate =forward= and =backward= blocks for that 💡

These methods follow the naming and behavior of dslide's [[*Stateful Sequence][stateful sequence]] interface.  The babel action is basically delegating stateful sequence calls into the blocks of your org document.

The babel action also understands regular babel options such as =:exports= and =:results=.  Exports none will make the block invisible.  Results controls whether results will be printed into the buffer or not.
*** Step Callbacks
#+findex: dslide-push-step
#+cindex: pushing steps
See ~dslide-push-step~ for inserting arbitrary callbacks that can function as steps.  Unless your action performs state tracking to decide when to consume ~dslide-deck-forward~ and ~dslide-deck-backward~ itself, a callback may be easier.  Using ~dslide-push-step~ is also one way to optionally add a step callback from a babel block.
** Hiding Markup
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: No More Ugly
:END:
#+findex: dslide-action-hide-markup
#+vindex: dslide-hide-markup-types
Dslide uses a lot of markup that would not look good in a presentation.  It also filters it by default using ~dslide-action-hide-markup~.  You can adjust the types using ~dslide-hide-markup-types~
*** Hiding Todos and Tags
#+vindex: dslide-hide-todo
#+vindex: dslide-hide-tags
~dslide-action-hide-markup~ will also hide todos and tags.  You can modifiy this with ~dslide-hide-todo~ and ~dslide-hide-tags~.
** Filtering Headings
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: It's Not Done Yet
:END:
#+cindex: commented headings
- Any heading with =COMMENT= directly after the stars will be skipped
- Any heading with the =:noslide:= or =:noexport:= tags will be skipped

Use this when your headings are work-in-progress and you run out of time on Friday before the feature demo meeting.  Have some content that is only not used in presentations?  Use =:noslide:=.

#+vindex: dslide-default-filter
To change the filtering from what is done by ~dslide-built-in-filter~, customize ~dslide-default-filter~ or set =DSLIDE_FILTER= (possibly implemented 🤡, file an issue!).
** Header Keywords
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Title, Author, Breadcumbs
:END:
#+vindex: dslide-header
If ~dslide-header~ is configured, the keywords for the document title, email, and author etc will be used to generate an okay header.

#+begin_src org
  #+,#+title:	Domain Specific sLIDEs
  ,#+author:	Positron
  ,#+email:	contact@positron.solutions
#+end_src

#+vindex: dslide-header-email
You can try customizing with ~dslide-header-email~ and similar variables or just set ~dslide-header-fun~ to complete replace the header with your own device.
*** Breadcrumbs
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Showing Parent Headings
:END:
#+vindex: dslide-breadcrumb-separator
Whenever ~dslide-breadcrumb-separator~ is non-nil, breadcrumbs will be rendered in the heading, displaying parent headings so the audience an track context.

#+vindex: dslide-breadcrumb-face
Because breadcrumb text comes from your headings, you may want to set a face on them to prevent various heading faces from leaking into the breadcrumbs.
** File Local Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Don't Forget Free Lunch
:END:
Don't forget that if you need a customize variable only set in a particular presentation, you can use file local variables.  Not every setting needs a keyword or babel block integration.

#+begin_src org
  # Local Variables:
  # dslide-header: nil
  # End:
#+end_src
* Presenting
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Controlling the Presentation
:END:
How to control and view your presentation.
** Two Button Interface
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Its All Forwards and Backwards
:END:
Presentations tend to be organized into a scripted linear sequence.  We want to control the entire presentation sequence mostly with two buttons, forwards and backwards.

The controllers for presenting usually have very few buttons.  Dslide was designed with this usage pattern in mind and can mostly be controlled by two commands.

#+findex: dslide-deck-forward
- ~dslide-deck-forward~
#+findex: dslide-deck-backward
- ~dslide-deck-backward~

#+findex: dslide-deck-start
Many controllers also have a "play" button or similar.  It's recommended to map this to ~dslide-deck-start~.

#+cindex: secondary action
🚧 It is intended to overload ~dslide-deck-start~ further to implement "secondary" actions that can be triggered non-linearly.

#+findex: dslide-deck-stop
There is likely no good place to bind ~dslide-deck-stop~, but it's not critical.  You can do everything with just three buttons.
** Contents Interface
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Navigating Faster
:END:
Navigate your presentation faster when answering questions.  The contents interface is a view of top-level headings.  It overloads the presentation controls to navigate.

To enter the contents, call ~dslide-deck-start~ when a presentation is already active.

- ~dslide-deck-start~ will resume the presentation at that heading
- ~dslide-deck-stop~ will similarly exit the contents view
- ~dslide-deck-forward~ and ~dslide-deck-backward~ move between top level headings.
** Narrating
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: And Debugging Live
:END:
The presentation you see is a cloned [[info:elisp#Indirect Buffers][indirect buffer]] of your org mode buffer. The Elisp state and overlays are independent. There are two key advantages:

- Any state you create in the presentation (besides buffer text and text properties!) will not pollute the org mode buffer you are editing
- We can display the source for the presentation simultaneously, making one pretty while leaving the other to show us what is hidden

#+findex: dslide-deck-develop
~dslide-deck-develop~ will attempt to display both the presentation and source simultaneously.  Whenever the source is visible, highlights will be applied to indicate where the presentation is at.  *This is especially helpful for including presentation notes in comments, which are hidden by default*.

To leave a comment for yourself in the presentation source, just add a comment block or comment line:

#+begin_src org
  # This is also a comment

  ,#+begin_comment
  This is a comment that only I can see while presenting, only when I look at my base buffer while sharing another frame.
  ,#+end_comment
#+end_src

You can also switch a window to the base buffer manually.  That's almost all ~dslide-deck-develop~ does.
** Cursor Visibility
#+findex: dslide-cursor-hide
#+findex: dslide-cursor-restore
By default, the cursor is hidden in the presentation buffer using ~dslide-cursor-hide~.  You can call ~dslide-cursor-restore~ if you need it.

Another good choice for interactive presentations is to use ~moc-subtle-cursor-mode~ from the [[https://github.com/positron-solutions/moc][Master of Ceremonies]] package.  It is more like having a laser pointer that hides itself automatically.
* Configuring
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Global Settings
:END:
Be sure to check =M-x= ~customize-group~ =dslide= to see all declared custom variables. All of the variables are configured to recommended defaults except hooks, which would depend on other packages usually.

Many settings can be configured at:
- global level through customize variables
- document level through keywords
- slide level through the property drawer
** Binding
You likely want to start the mode via ~dslide-deck-start~.  Once the mode starts, it creates an indirect buffer to display the slides and then calls ~dslide-deck-start-function~ once the mode is active and everything is initialized, so you can customize startup behavior.

All commands begin with ~dslide-deck~ 💡
#+begin_src elisp
  (keymap-set org-mode-map "<f5>" #'dslide-deck-start)
#+end_src
Once the global minor mode, ~dslide-mode~ is active, additional bindings in ~dslide-mode-map~ are active in every buffer so that you can integrate other buffers into your presentation.  (Tracking which buffers are part of a presentation is  still a topic under consideration 🚧)
*** Secondary Commands 🚧
Because you might want to play a video or take a branch in the presentation and then exit that branch, the plan is to overload the ~dslide-deck-start~ binding within presentations to enter / exit these branches.
** Hooks
Beware of using the normal ~dslide-mode-hook~ 😱 because it runs *in the base buffer* ⚠️.  If you use that hook to remap faces or add a bunch of styling, state will be copied to the indirect buffer but then linger in your base buffer.  Instead, use ~dslide-start-hook~. 💡

- ~dslide-start-hook~ is run in the indirect buffer after it is set it.  This is what you want.
- ~dslide-stop-hook~ is run in the base buffer because the indirect buffer is already dead.
- ~dslide-contents-hook~ is run after switching to contents.  It runs in the slide buffer.
- ~dslide-narrow-hook~ is run after narrowing, usually after a slide is started
- ~dslide-after-last-slide-hook~ is run when the user tries to go forward but there are no more slides.  You can use this to implement a final feedback before quitting or add ~dslide-deck-stop~ to exit without feedback.

  Another option is to use ~dslide-push-step~ to push a callback that will only run when called going forward.

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun my-stop-if-forward ()
    (dslide-push-step (lambda (direction)
                    (when (eq direction 'forward)
                      ;; Be sure to return t or the callback won't count as a
                      ;; step and the hook will run again.
                      (prog1 t (dslide-deck-stop))))))

  (setq dslide-after-last-slide-hook #'my-stop-if-forward)
#+end_src
*** Per-Slide Actions
💡 If you want to do something on each slide or specific slides, before using hooks, instead consider using actions.

See the ~dslide-action-hide-markup~ which is by default added to ~dslide-default-actions~ and hides markup on every slide.  The lifecycle of actions and their methods for obtaining the current slide's heading make them very good for per-slide behavior.
** Steezing Org
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Making it Pretty
:END:
This is not unique to dslide, but if you want more professional looking results, you will likely need to make your org a bit prettier.

The setup used for the Positron's YouTube demos is not much more complex than this well-documented setup by [[https://systemcrafters.net/emacs-tips/presentations-with-org-present/][System Crafters]].  Also see Prot's [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-07-17-emacs-mixed-fonts-org/][further]] documentation on customizing org mode faces and fonts.

In short, use:
- ~org-modern~
- ~org-appear~
- ~nerd-icons~ for more cheesy (Emacs logo)
- And set the faces for org headings and document title.

Don't forget built-in ~emoji-search~ and searching ~insert-char~.

Positron is cheating and also apply custom line-spacing and line-height.  While Psionic maintains a custom ~org-modern~, using custom spacing everywhere fights with ~visual-line-mode~ currently.
* Extending
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Custom Actions
:END:
Creating new actions or replacing dslide classes.
** Creating Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Overview
:END:
Actions are the right choice when you need custom behavior that you want to re-use.  Actions can be configured with arguments.  They implement the stateful sequence lifecycle.  For one-off solutions, you probably just want a babel block.

First choose your action type:

#+findex: dslide-action
- Override ~dslide-action~ to create an action that works mainly on a heading's section content.
#+findex: dslide-slide-action
- Override ~dslide-slide-action~ to create a slide action.  Your action will control the display of the slide and its children, usually controlling the narrow state and adding or removing overlays from children.

Override methods as appropriate, configure a heading to use your action, and you're done.  Some actions, such as ~dslide-action-propertize~ only work when some of the section data is annotated.
** A Custom Action
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Example Class
:END:
#+findex: dslide-section-next
#+findex: dslide-section-previous
The ~dslide-section-next~  and ~dslide-section-previous~ method documentation are very helpful behavior for quickly writing custom actions.  They advance the action's =:marker= forwards and backwards to the next matching element and return that element so we can do something with it.

- declare a class
- override a few methods
- now you too can paint the paragraphs red

Example code:

#+begin_src elisp
  (defclass dslide-action-red-paragraphs (dslide-action)
    ((overlays :initform nil))
    "Paint the paragraphs red, one by one.")

  ;; Default no-op `dslide-begin' is sufficient

  ;; Default implementation of `dslide-end', which just plays forward to the end,
  ;; is well-behaved with this class.

  ;; Remove any remaining overlays when calling final.
  (cl-defmethod dslide-final :after ((obj dslide-action-red-paragraphs))
    (mapc #'delete-overlay (oref obj overlays)))

  ;; Find the next paragraph and add an overlay if it exists
  (cl-defmethod dslide-forward ((obj dslide-action-red-paragraphs))
    (when-let ((paragraph (dslide-section-next obj 'paragraph)))
      (let* ((beg (org-element-property :begin paragraph))
             (end (org-element-property :end paragraph))
             (new-overlay (make-overlay beg end)))
        (overlay-put new-overlay 'face 'error)
        (push new-overlay (oref obj overlays))
        ;; Return non-nil to indicate progress was made.  This also informs the
        ;; highlight when following the slides in the base buffer.
        beg)))

  (cl-defmethod dslide-backward ((obj dslide-action-red-paragraphs))
    (when-let* ((overlay (pop (oref obj overlays))))
      (delete-overlay overlay)
      ;; If there is a preceding overlay, move to its beginning else move to the
      ;; beginning of the heading.
      (if-let ((overlay (car (oref obj overlays))))
          (dslide-marker obj (overlay-start overlay))
        (dslide-marker obj (org-element-property :begin (dslide-heading obj))))))
#+end_src
** Default Classes
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Overriding the Guts
:END:
The deck and slide class as well as actions can be sub-classed.  Use the existing sub-classes of actions as example code for writing other classes.  See the [[info:eieio#Top][eieio#Top]] manual for explanation of OOP in Elisp.

- =Action=:  Creating new action subclasses are an efficient way to perform similar operations on typical kinds of org data.
- =Slide:=  Slides can be configured extensively by changing their actions.  However, for more vertical cooperation between slides or cooperation among actions, extended slides could be useful.
- =Deck=:  If the core methods of the deck are insufficient, extension is another option besides advice, hooks, and modifying the source.

  If you suspect you might need to sub-class the ~dslide-slide~ or ~dslide-deck~, please file an issue because your use case is probably interesting.
* Hacking
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Understanding the Guts
:END:
This section provides really high-level summary of the code's major design choices to prepare for diving into source.
** Objects & Ownership
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: What Holds What
:END:
Org mode uses trees.  Presentations are linear sequences.  We can either traverse the tree or flatten it.  Dslide chose to traverse.  This design allowed implementing features such as ~dslide-slide-action-each-child~.  The children of such a parent slide exist simultaneously.  A consequence of the choice not to flatten is that parents own their children.  The lifecycle of a parent always encompasses its child.

- The deck object is the root of all functionality and many commands delegate through it
- The deck owns slides, which own actions
- Slide actions may further own child slides

*** Life Cycles
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: What Lives When
:END:
Owning an object also means out-living it.  This is important to understanding the sequence of events.  The methods used for the lifecycle are part of dslide's [[*Stateful Sequence][Stateful Sequence]].  Every lifecyle starts with ~dslide-begin~ or ~dslide-end~ (depending on whether we go forward or backward) and ends with ~dslide-final~.

The state of the slide out-lives the state of its slide action.  The slide action out-lives both child slides and section actions.  Child slides and section actions life cycles may overlap.

The child and section actions orders can vary depending on the slide action's choices.  There may be multiple children alive at one time.  The children may complete after, before, or at the same time as the section actions.

*Going forward:*

1. slide ~dslide-begin~
2.   slide action ~dslide-begin~
3.     section actions + child slides ~dslide-begin~
4.     section actions + child slides ~dslide-final~
5.   slide action ~dslide-final~
6. slide ~dslide-final~

*Going backward:*

1. slide ~dslide-end~
2.   slide action ~dslide-end~
5.     child slides + section actions ~dslide-end~
6.     child slides + section actions ~dslide-final~
7.   slide action ~dslide-final~
8. slide ~dslide-final~
** Stateful Sequence
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Most Important Interface
:END:
#+findex: dslide-stateful-sequence
#+findex: dslide-forward
#+findex: dslide-backward
Presentations are supposed to be linear sequences.  We want to traverse the sequence, performing the steps, entirely by calling ~dslide-forward~ and ~dslide-backward~.

If all sequences were idempotent, we would only implement ~dslide-forward~ and ~dslide-backward~.  However, sequences often require setup and teardown before carrying out a single step.  This is the "stateful" part.

Implementing this without explicit setup methods crammed too much behavior into ~dslide-forward~ and ~dslide-backward~ while also requiring them to decide if they were attempting to make progress or just performing setup.  It was annoying when building actions.

#+findex: dslide-begin
#+findex: dslide-end
Setup and teardown can happen in both directions, so there is ~dslide-begin~ and ~dslide-end~.  The latter commonly calls the former and then advances the state to the end, but some more optimal setups are possible and already in use.

#+findex: dslide-final
Slides may be disposed of after they no longer make progress.  To allow intended cleanup to happen at the right moment, the parent calls ~dslide-final~.  This can be called at any time after ~dslide-end~ or ~dslide-begin~.

The return values for these methods matter!  See [[*Flow Control][flow control]].
*** Flow Control
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Controlling Progress
:END:
Decks, slides, and actions implement the ~dslide-stateful-sequence~ interface.  On each call to ~dslide-deck-forward~ or ~dslide-deck-backward~, the deck receives the first call to its ~dslide-forward~ method.  First, the deck will check for any step callbacks.  (These may be added with ~dslide-push-step~ in actions or babel blocks.)  If there are no step callbacks, the deck delegates ~dslide-forward~ to the slide.  The slide may delegate down to an action, which may then further delegate to a child slide and so on.  Eventually, an action will implement the step.

#+cindex: controlling progress
The return value tells the parent if progress was made.  In the most basic case, each delegate will try all of its actions until one returns non-nil.  The delegate returns the first non-nil result.  If the delegate returns nil, it means it was unable to make progress, and so the caller will instead try its own next action.  The deck will find a root level sibling and hydrate it using ~dslide--make-slide~.  A child action would find the next child and hydrate that.

The moment of calling ~dslide-final~ can vary depending on the situation.  If there is only one slide at a time, ~dslide-final~ is usually called right after the child returns nil.  If the child is one of several, such as with ~dslide-slide-action-inline~, then only after all children complete will they have their ~dslide-final~ called.  If the presentation is quit early or the contents are opened, ~dslide-final~ is also called, possibly before all steps are complete.

Whenever all slides and actions return nil all the way back up to the deck, it looks for a next or previous top-level heading to make into a slide.  If none is found, it indicates that the user is at the beginning or end of the presentation.

The deck object and slide actions frequently create new children from org headings.  They call their ~dslide-begin~ or ~dslide-end~ methods right after that.  If these methods don't indicate progress, the ~dslide-forward~ or ~dslide-back~ method will be called.
** Instantiating Slides
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Making Slides From Org Elements
:END:
#+findex: dslide--make-slide
Slides are created by calling ~dslide--make-slide~ with an org element for a heading.  This function interprets the class name and arguments for the new slide and instantiates the object.

The default classes and actions can be configured at the document or customize level.  Set the =DSLIDE_DECK_CLASS= and =DSLIDE_SLIDE_CLASS= as well as other properties that work at the heading level.  The order of precedence (*Not fully implemented* 🚧):

- Property definition of the current heading
- Property definition in the document
- Customize variable

~dslide--make-slide~ will look in order for the highest precedence setting and then instantiate the class with that value in the slot.
** Display
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Visual Things
:END:
How various visual effects are achieved.
*** Hiding
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: With Overlays
:END:
The slide buffer, being an indirect clone of the base buffer, does not have independent text properties. For this reason, overlays are typically used to hide content.

Most things that are hidden could be once again revealed.  This is typically accomplished by mutating or deleting the overlay.
*** Animation
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Timers & Overlays
:END:
There are currently two animation types, peel and slide-in:

- Peel uses an overlay that is removed from the content one character at a time.  In order to preserve the flow of the obscured contents, such as when doing inline reveal with content after the reveal, the overlay must either match the background color or use the display property.
- Slide-in uses an overlay with a =:before-string= text property to insert a newline in order to use the =:line-height= property to slowly remove padding with a timer.

Peel is the default when an action or slide's =:inline= property is non-nil.  If multiple actions try to slide in at once, the result will not be good.  This is visible when combining ~dslide-slide-action-every-child~ and ~dslide-action-item-reveal~
*** Full Screen Images
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Image Mode Buffer
:END:
These are just image buffers with the mode line turned off.
** Element Mapping
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Working With Org Data
:END:
Org's Element API is the foundation on top of which dslide is built.  It's documentation is not currently in a manual.  Here's the web link:  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][Org Element API docs]].  By using the element parser, we can avoid the issues that plague regex based implementations.  (The trade-off is more garbage generation.)

Very frequently, we parse a section of the document and map over elements or headings within.  This allows us to treat the document or a part of it as a list.  The mapping functions all eventually delegate to ~dslide--map~ which itself uses ~org-element-map~, narrowed to the targeted region.

It is very common when writing actions to work on only the section or only the children.  For this reason, some shortcuts to map the section or children exist.  Some section actions such as ~dslide-action-hide-markup~ are almost entirely built ~on dslide-section-map~.

Frequently we are looking for an element before or after a marker, so shortcuts exist for finding the next or previous element.  Section actions typically use ~dslide-section-next~ and ~dslide-section-previous~.  Slide actions typically use ~dslide-child-next~ and  ~dslide-child-previous~ to traverse the child headings.

Mapping and [[*Progress Tracking][progress tracking]] are intimately related.  Finding the previous or next element is implemented by mapping to find the element beginning before or after a certain point.  Careful handling of markers and a consistent scheme for sensing progress enable markers in the buffer to act as progress cursors for a variety of actions.
** Progress Tracking
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Markers and You
:END:
#+findex: dslide-heading
Dslide's predecessor, org-tree-slide, frequently used the point to track state.  This can be fragile and there is also only one point.  To be more robust when the document is changing out from under us, dslide uses markers.

#+findex: dslide-section-next
#+findex: dslide-section-previous
Slides keep a reference to the heading in their =:begin= slot and then retrieve it using ~org-element-at-point~.  Actions similarly use a marker in order to keep track of how much of the current heading they have already used.  For convenience, ~dslide-section-next~ and ~dslide-section-previous~ are used to simultaneously find the next element and update the marker, eliminating silly mistakes like forgetting to update the marker.

#+cindex: reversing in place
There are two schemes in place for tracking progress:

- When viewing a sequence of images, we reverse by going back to the previous image rather than re-showing the current image.  This is the default progress scheme.
- When showing and hiding elements, we reverse undoing the most recent work.  This means hiding the most recently shown or showing the most recently hidden element.  This is the scheme used when REVERSE-IN-PLACE is non-nil.

⚠️ This section is fiddly and tricky.  Put on your smarty hat.  👷

*Normal Progress*

In short, find the element beginning after (before in reverse) the marker, move the marker to its beginning, and work on that element.  If there is no next element, move as far as you can.

- The heading always begins before the first element.  We can reliably position before all elements by putting the marker at the beginning of the heading.
- To go forward, we find the first element beginning after the marker and move the marker to its beginning.  We work on that element.  It will be skipped if we immediately go backward again.
- If there is no next element, we move the marker to the end of the heading, which is after the beginning of the last element.
- To go backward, we find the first element beginning before the marker and move the marker to its beginning.  We work on that element.  It will be skipped if we immediately go forward again.

*Reverse In Place Progress*

If doing work means the next reverse step should undo that work, you need reversing in place.  We need to slightly tweak our rules to allow two states on each element.  Since every element ends after it begins, we can reliably use the end and beginning positions to differentiate if we already used an element when going forwards or backwards.

A very deliberate design choice was to avoid needing to return more than one element from a mapping call.  This means we always want to find the element we intend to work on e.g. we do not want to find the element to work on and then have to find the next element to update the marker.

- To go forward, we find the first element beginning at or after the marker.  We move the marker to the end of this element and work on this element.
- To go backward, we find the first element ending at or before the marker.  We move the marker to the beginning of this element and work on this element.
- Going forward, begin at the beginning of the heading just like normal progress.  The first element will not be skipped.
- Going backward, begin at the end of the heading.  This is at most the end of the last element, so it won't be skipped.

☢️ Before these two schemes were developed, some actions were easier to implement one way while others were easier the other way.  There was much flip-flopping and radiation sickness from broken actions.  Eventually it was realized that both schemes make perfect sense for the right problems.

⚠️ Org elements can and do overlap.  Lists are one such challenge.  List elements can all end at the same location.  Naively calling ~org-element-at-point~ is a bad idea.  See ~dslide-action-item-reveal~ for higher level interfaces.

If you need more states per element, this kind of implicit state tracking is insufficient and you will have to implement state-tracking.  ⚠️  Don't use text properties to store state in buffer text since they will persist in the base buffer between presentation starts if not cleaned up.

Open issues and give feedback on feature requests.  Contributions welcome.  See the [[https://github.com/positron-solutions/dslide/issues/20][1.0 feature roadmap]].
*** Affiliated Keyword
This is the future of dslide.  Currently adding behavior to content can frequently require adding actions to the property drawer and then adding a keyword to the content.  This lacks precision, is unintuitive, and is inconvenient.  ~dslide-action-propertize~ shows the way.  A dispatch system should find all =dslide= prefixed affiliated keywords and activate the actions with the configuration.  This is faster and more concise.  It only requires editing in one place rather than two.

The property drawer will remain in use because headings have slide behavior that doesn't make sense to adjust with affiliated keywords.  For behavior affecting section elements or operating on objects within paragraphs, the affiliated keyword implementation is the right way.
*** Layout
A centering action is in the works.

Another option is using the [[https://github.com/positron-solutions/moc][Master of Ceremonies]] package and its ~moc-focus~ command implement desirable behaviors such as filling the available space and padding the content to the center of the window.  This behavior could easily be improved and adapted into an action.
*** Slide Action Precedence
When a slide is created in ~dslide-make-slide~, it can obtain them from several places:
- passed in arguments, as slide actions do to prevent children from trying to display themselves
- properties, how slides are usually configured
- customize variables that set the default actions.
The order of precedence and capability to override options is still pretty immature.
*** Secondary Commands
See the section about bindings for context.  Video play or other situations where the presentation might branch should be supported by overloading the behavior of ~dslide-deck-start~.  I think this command will turn into ~dslide-deck-secondary~ in the ~dslide-mode-map~.
*** Starting From Point
Since not many actions currently have implemented ~dslide-goto~ very accurately, playing from point is likely not that accurate.  Progress updating in the base buffer is also currently only at the slide level of granularity.
*** Affiliated Buffers
There is no tracking whether a buffer is part of the presentation or not.  How would a buffer become one?  Should it be implicit?  Without any sort of tracking, the consequence is that having a presentation open leaves the minor mode bindings hot.  These commands do weird things when run from these situations, especially if running babel scripts, so some kind of first-class buffer affiliation seems necessary.
*** Non-Graphic Display
For terminals, the line-height based slide-in effect is not supported.
*** Improper Levels
Children with no parents or missing a level are currently not supported and likely cause bad behavior.
*** Counting Slides
Especially if slides launch sub-sequences, and they do it from Lisp, this is hard.  Buffer slides and also slide actions make it somewhat ambiguous.  Counting trees or tracking the point might be easier.  A ~children~ method for sequences works as long as sequences actually implement it.
*** Non-Org Sequences
There's no concrete reason why presentations need to start with Org mode buffers.  The deck object could have its org-specific functionality pushed down to an org-mode class.  The only requirement is to be able to hydrate some stateful sequences, which may hydrate and call into sub-sequences, meaning anything is pretty trivially possible.
